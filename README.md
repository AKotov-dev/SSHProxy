# SSHProxy
GUI for connecting to an external proxy through an SSH tunnel (port forwarding, encryption)  
  
**Dependencies:** openssh-clients sshpass systemd gtk2  
  
If the connection is established, `127.0.0.1:8080` will be listened to. Set this data in the `proxy settings` of your `browser`. To manage the proxy in the Google Chrome browser, you can use the `ProxyControl` plugin. The external proxy port is the `Squid` ports (usually 3128 or 8080, depending on the server settings). Your new location and security level can be checked at [here](https://whoer.net).
